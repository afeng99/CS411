Idea 1: Use an artwork emotion database to match Spotify listening to famous artwork. Have the user authenticate with Spotify, then either take their the top song of the week or a manually inputted one and return a famous artwork that matches the features/sentiments of the song. Spotify API will be used for authentication. We will obtain the lyrics of the song from the Spotify API and send them to the Watson API to receive a sentiment analysis. WikiArt Emotions Database is a dataset of mostly paintings that has annotations for emotions evoked when the painting is observed. We will be using the results of the sentiment analysis to find a painting from the dataset that matches the sentiment analysis from Watson. We will then store the match between the sentiment of the song and the painting in a database for each user so it can later be referenced. 

Idea 2: Use the Ticketmaster/concert API to find concerts or events based on what you listen to on Spotify. The user will authenticate with Spotify. Using the Spotify API, we will obtain a list of the user’s top artists and choose the most common genre(s) among their favorite artists. The genres will then be passed into the Ticketmaster API with the user’s inputted zip code or city to find events near them with filters on the event date. We will then store the user’s zip code(location) and a record log of our web app’s recommendations.
