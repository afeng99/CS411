#User Story 4

As a user, I want to be able to view some recommended artwork and song pairings to see other examples.

This is important to the application because the user will be able to view their “progress” over time with how their Spotify listening history corresponds to their moods. It will work as a log of their listening history over time, with the ability to go back and view previous artwork/song matches. The user can see the images of the artwork, and click to be redirected to the song associated with that piece of art. 
	
The ideal case is the user wanting to some listening/artwork paired history of all users in the app. They would click on the history page and be able to scroll through the previous pairings to find new artwork from songs they may be familiar with.

An exception to this would be if a lot of people utilize the application often because it may be difficult for the user to find a song or artwork again. This can be solved by the user reentering the song into the search feature and having either the same or a similar piece of artwork recommended.
