#User Story 4

As a user, I want to be able to view some recommended artwork and song pairings to see whether or not I want to use the application.

This is important to the application because the user will be able to view example artwork and song pairings and it will illustrate what the webvapplication will do. It gives a user a better understanding of whether or not they want to use our web application. 
	
The ideal case is the user finds our web application and is curious about what it does. It will look at the example pairings and will want to get an artwork for a song they have been recently listening to. They will therefore log in to the web application with their spotify account and proceed to getting the song/artwork pairing the user wanted. 

An exception to this would be if the user does not find the artwork/song pairings good or interesting. They come to the web application expecting a specific style of art and they don't like the pairings they are seeing as examples. This can be solved by making the artwork generation more catered to the user's wants and add a filter option where they can select the style of art they want to see for example.
