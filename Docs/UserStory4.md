#User Story 4

As a user, I want to be able to view my previously recommended artwork, in order to track my moods.

This is important to the application because the user will be able to view their “progress” over time with how their Spotify listening history corresponds to their moods. It will work as a log of their listening history over time, with the ability to go back and view previous artwork/song matches. The user can see the images of the artwork, and click to be redirected to the song associated with that piece of art. 
	
The ideal case is the user wanting to view their listening/artwork paired history. They would click on their profile page and be able to scroll through the previous pairings to find artwork they’ve liked in the past. They would then be able to click on that artwork to be redirected to Spotify to listen to that song while viewing the artwork selected to match the mood of that song.

An exception to this would be a user who listens to a lot of music and uses the application often because it may be difficult for the user to find a song or artwork again. This can be solved by the user favoriting song/artwork pairings to be viewed more easily on their profile.
