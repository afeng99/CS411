#User Story 1

As a user, I want to be able to login to my account in order to keep my personal information private.

When the user first wants to access the app, the user will be prompted to login page. There will be a "Login to Spotify" button to transfer the user to Spotify Login page that the user can type its username and password. We want to be able to login in order to keep all of our information in one secure place. Being able to login makes it more convenient for the user as they don’t have to keep inputting personal information. In the ideal case, the user would login and see their personal information such as name, age and favorite music songs and genre. We don’t foresee much going wrong with authenticating the user if they have the right credentials. Problems might arise if the user forgets its password, but since our login is done through Spotify, authentication problems should be solved through Spotify.
