#User Story 5

As a user, I want to be able to view the lyrics and other song "features" alongside the artwork and song pairing to better understand how they match.

We want to be able to view these features of the song to be able to give more insight to the user as to why the pairing was made. Considering the song is analyzed primarily on lyrics, it is important to allow the user to see what the decision for the artwork pairing is made on. This makes the user more likely to repeatedly use the application as they can see and understand how the pairing works. 

In the happy path, once a user inputs their song choice, the app returns an artwork that matches the sentiments of the song along with the lyrics and other features that best represent why the artwork was chosen as a match.

An exception that could arise is if the user is given the same song multiple times and recieves the same lyrics and features but a different artwork. This can be solved by a disclaimer that the application picks at random from a pool of artwork within the different emotions.
