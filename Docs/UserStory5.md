#User Story 5

As a user, I want to be able to favorite artworks when I receive my results in order to keep track of my favorite pairings of artwork and songs.

We want to be able to select and save our favorite artworks because this adds a personal and interactive aspect to the user experience. Each user profile can have their selected artworks from their previous results so they can see a built up history of their favorite results over time. This makes the user more likely to repeatedly use the application as they can see a personalized page of their favorite works all together. 

In the happy path, once a user inputs their song choice, the app returns an artwork that matches the sentiments of the song. There will be a button the user can select, such as a heart or thumbs up, to indicate that they can add it to their favorites on their profile. These selections persist over time, so that once the artwork is selected, the user can return to their profile to view their entire list of favorites. 

An exception that could arise is if the user is given the same artwork more than once for different songs. If this occurs, then we will have some logic implemented to ensure the same artwork won’t be duplicated on their favorites page. Another possibility is if the user wants to remove a favorite, whether due to an accidental favorite or a change of heart. If this is the case, they will be able to “unfavorite” it and remove it from their favorites page.
