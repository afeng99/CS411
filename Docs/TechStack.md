#Tech Stack Reasoning

##Frontend:
We were between React Native and Angular in deciding what frontend framework we wanted to work with. In our decision, we weighed what we were each familiar working with, the online resources available to help us troubleshoot and work through any issues we may run into, and overall accessability. In the end, we decided to work with React Native because a few team members had some limited experience in it and it seemed to have more online resources available to help us through the development process. 

##Backend
Our decision was between using Django and Flask to host our backend server. We made our decision based on what type of database we would be using (relational or non-relational). Django seemed to favor more realational database pairings, and it seemed like we would need to use a lot of workarounds to connect a non-relational database. After deciding that using a non-relational database was the most important aspect of our backend, we decided to go with Flask because it seemed to be the better pariing with this type of database.

##Connecting our frontend and backend
Our team members were successfully able to connect a React frontend to the Flask backend utilizing the following tutorial: https://dev.to/nagatodev/how-to-connect-flask-to-reactjs-1k8i.
