#User Story 2

As a user, I want to link to my Spotify account as a means of logging in so that I do not have to create a new account and can use a preexisting, related application login that I trust. 

The user should be able to login to the application as detailed in user story 1. By logging in through Spotify, the user can feel more secure in their password and account information to know it is not being held on our application. In the perfect scenario, the user would have a preexisitng Spotify account and would simply login through the pop-up authentication window. An exception would be a user who does not have a Spotify account, and the solution would be having them create one through the pop-up authentication login window so it would still be handled by Spotify.
