#User Story 2

As a user, I want to link to my Spotify account, in order to have easy access to select my recently listened to music. 

The user should be able to login to the application as detailed in user story 1. By linking Spotify history, the user can easily select a song from their listening history. This makes it more convenient as compared to having them type a song name in to search for it. In the ideal case, a user would log in using Spotify credentials which will show them their Spotify history and most listened to songs. One exception might be that the user does not have a Spotify account and wants to use the web app without one. To solve this they could be prompted to create a Spotify account.
