#User Story 3

As a user, I want to be able to input a song in order to look at artwork that matches the song’s mood.

We want the user to be able to choose a song from their most recently listened to. This will provide some convenience/flexibility to the user, as they are not limited in which songs they are able to input into the system. In the typical case, after authentication described in User Story 1, the user will be able to see their most recently listened to songs as described in User Story 2. The user can then choose which song they would like to use for the artwork generation. The exception for this would be, if the user would like to use a song for the analysis which is not on their most recently listen to. In this case, the user would need to return to Spotify and listen to the desired song, before being able to choose and use that for artwork generation.
