# Song / Artwork Pairing Application
by Amy Feng Chen, Erin McAteer, Skyler Gauuan, Kruthik Ravishankar, Pratima Vaidyanathan, Xiao Wen

## Description
Our application uses an artwork emotion dataset to match Spotify songs to famous artwork. The the user authenticates with Spotify, then can input a song and artist they'd like to pair to a piece of artwork that matches the features and sentiments of the song lyrics. Spotify is used for authentication and to search for the song features, the lyrics of the song are obtained from Genius API and then sent to the IBM Watson to receive a sentiment analysis. WikiArt Emotions Database is a dataset of mostly paintings that has annotations for emotions evoked when the painting is observed. We will be using the results of the sentiment analysis to find a painting from the dataset that matches the sentiment analysis from Watson. We will then store the match between the sentiment of the song and the painting in a database to display a few additional pairings of artwork as examples.
